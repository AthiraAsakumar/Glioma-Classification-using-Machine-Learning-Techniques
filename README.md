# Glioma Classification using Machine Learning Techniques

## Overview

Glioma, a type of brain tumor, is known for its significant heterogeneity, which complicates its accurate classification using traditional diagnostic methods. The advent of machine learning (ML) techniques and the availability of molecular data have presented new avenues for improving glioma classification. This project explores the potential of classifying gliomas based on their molecular characteristics using various machine learning techniques.

## Inspiration and Approach

Inspired by recent advancements in glioma grading methodologies, especially the hierarchical voting-based feature selection and ensemble learning model proposed by Tasci et al. (2022), this study investigates the classification potential of diverse machine learning techniques using molecular features. Our approach stands out due to the careful selection of machine learning models that have demonstrated improved accuracy rates compared to existing methods.

## Methods and Data

The dataset used in this study comprises molecular features extracted from glioma samples. We applied six distinct machine learning algorithms:

- GaussianProcessClassifier
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- XGBoost
- GradientBoostingClassifier

Experiments were conducted using four different feature sets: 10 features, 15 features, and the full set of features. This allowed us to evaluate the efficacy of these algorithms comprehensively.

## Results

Our findings revealed that the Gaussian Naive Bayes model achieved the highest accuracy rate of 92.26% when utilizing the full feature set. Additionally, the GaussianProcessClassifier, XGBoost, and GradientBoostingClassifier also demonstrated competitive accuracy rates of 91.67%. All models maintained high levels of accuracy across various feature subsets, indicating the robustness of these techniques in glioblastoma classification tasks.

## Conclusion

These results highlight the potential of machine learning techniques to effectively classify glioblastoma based on molecular characteristics. The success of the selected models encourages further investigation and integration of these methods into clinical practice, aiming to improve glioma diagnosis and patient outcomes. However, further research and validation on larger and more diverse datasets are necessary to confirm the generalizability and clinical relevance of these models.
